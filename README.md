Side-Scrolling engine for the Commander X16

Running the game:
	Load the file SSE.PRG into the commander X16 emulator.
	On windows, the easiest way to run it is the copy the emulator
	files into the game's directory and run the 
	rungame_controller.bat or rungame_keyboard.bat files


Changing levels:
	The json files in the tilemaps directory can be opened in the Tiled Map editor (https://www.mapeditor.org/)
	After changes are made, run buildlevel.exe or buildlevel.py to rebuild the binary files from the json files.
